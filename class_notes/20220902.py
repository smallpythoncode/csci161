indentation is important...obviously...you idiot.

ternary operation - middle is executed first
    expr_when_true if condition else expr_when_false

loops - executes a block of code through a number of iterations
while loops - based on a boolean
- sentinel values check a condition that dictates whether the loop will exec.

Turing test - indistinguishable from a human

for loops are ideal for iterating
- ideal for containers
- for dicts, keys are iterated
- reversed() iterates in reverse order...no shit

range()
- includes first, goes up to but doesn't include last

while vs. for
- for: counting; iterating
- while: known iterations; expecting input

Break statements can be used to break a loop if a condition is met
continue statement causes an immediate jump to the loop header statement
- skips the rest of the code block, starts the next iteration

Loop else statements

enumerate() - gets both the value and the index
