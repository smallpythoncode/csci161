This works for defaults


CLASS INTERFACES
consists of the methods that a programmer calls to create, modify,
or access a class instance
- setters and getters
- APIs

prepend internal classes w/ a single leading underscore to the name
of the function
- _not_for_external_use()
- this doesn't actually hide the info, it just signals to programmers
that it's not intended for general use
  - a gentleman's agreement
- ADT
  - user only has to focus on high-level operations


CLASS CUSTOMIZATION
- customize the use of common processes

Fun fact: computers don't like degrees, they prefer radians

# a way to skip comments for custom config files
if looker[0] == '#'
    continue

write log files to see how things are operating/if they are operating
correctly

os.path.sep - identifies the separator character by OS

it's a good idea to implement some time calculation for the
actual processing of the code
- don't assume it's instantaneous
- this will help with estimating how long calculations will take
