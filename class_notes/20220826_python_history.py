"""
Python supports the same escape sequences as other languages
\n example

input function is built into language
- will come out as string
- may need further processing for, say, ints
- allows for prompts
  - tells the user what sort of info is expected

Errors
1. Syntax error (typos, basically)
- will give you an error message to tell you what is wrong and where
- develop your code incrementally, break problem into sub-problems
2. Runtime errors
- syntactically is fine, but a wrong type is fed to a function
- tabs are different to multiple spaces
- NameError: program tries to use a variable that has not been defined
3. Logic errors (bugs)
- computers do exactly what you tell them to do
- no runtime or syntax errors, but the output is not what is expected

IDE
- Nordlie doesn't use one
- he used a text editor and runs it in the command line
- good to be able to use bare bones

- Analog computers use ranges of electrical current
  - creates noise in copying, same with cassettes
- digital computers use binary switches
  - still creates noise, but the noise can be easily detected and removed
  - limits to what we can represent with these computers
    - only 2 digits, not a range of el. currents like analog

machine instructions are just binary strings
assembler vs compiler
assembler - 1 for 1 as far as the language instructions
- variables need to manually moved/called
compiler - one instruction is likely a compilation of other "smaller"
  instructions
- variables are stored and can be easily recalled

clocks tick at a specific frequency

Scripting languages are used to execute programs w/o need for compilation
- via an interpreter
Python was developed with simplicity and readability in mind
- still focused on being powerful
- easy to learn and logical
- not a toy language, no constraints intended on power or sophistication
- many, many, many support packages available
- open-source
- v1.0 released in 1994
- v2.0 released in 2000
  - some integrated memory allocation and garbage clean-up
  - deprecated
- v3.0 is not backwards compatible
