RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS
- functions may call other functions
- it can even call itself, recursion
- not efficient to do a count-down
  - a loop would be better

ord()
- gives the number in the ascii table

Searches via recursive algorithm
guess a number between 1-100
- binary search algos are recursive
  - biforcation (?)
  - same algorithm (split range in half) and reduce range by half
  each time

- base case
  - condition under which recursion stops
- recursion case
  - a call for (further) recursion
